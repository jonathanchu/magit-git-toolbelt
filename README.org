`magit-git-toolbelt` is an Emacs package that integrates @nvie's git-toolbelt CLI utility into Magit. It provides a transiet menu interface to access `git-toolbelt` commands directly from Emacs without leaving your workflow.

Features include:
  - Branch management (cleanup merged branches, list recent/local/remote branches)
  - Commit info (initial commit, current branch, SHA with clipboard copy)
  - Diff inspection (deltas, merged/unmerged branches)
  - File status (modified, untracked files)
  - Actions (undo last commit)

TODO:
  - include comparison chart with missing features integrations from `git-toolbelt`

Requirements:
  - Emacs 26.1+
  - Magit 3.0.0+
  - git-toolbelt (installed separately)
